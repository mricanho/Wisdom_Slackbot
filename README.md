# Wisdom_Slackbot
This is my capstone project, a Wisdom Bot that runs on Slack.

Sometimes there are moments when we feel down, not wanting to continue our work, either because it is too much or because it's too complicated, this discourages us, until now.

Wisdom Bot was created to motivate you to finish the day.

The bot can deliver either a video that will help you with an ample spectred of topics or a short but insightful quote that will gradually redefine your mental paths.
